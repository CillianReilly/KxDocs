# <i class="fas fa-pen-nib"></i> Terminology


In 2017 and 2018 the terminology used to describe Kx technology was reviewed and revised to prefer terms in general use for concepts common with other programming languages, and to describe adverbs more clearly. 

The review deprecated and replaced these terms:

deprecated        | current
------------------|-------------------
monad, monadic    | unary
dyad, dyadic      | binary
nilad, niladic    | nullary
verb              | operator or keyword
adverb            | iterator
element of a list | item of a list
scalar            | atom

In contrast, to reflect the key roles played by values, iterators and the [Apply/Index operator](../../ref/apply.md)

deprecated               | current
-------------------------|--------
dimensions (of an array) | rank
valence (of a function)  | rank
